# Arduino Stair Lights Project
PIR Motion activated RGB led stair lights for Arduino Nano.

Goal of this project is to have animated RGB WS2801 stair lights using readily available control library provided by Adafruit.  
The lights are activated by 2 PIR Motion sensors located at the top and bottom of the stairs.

Colors and timings are hardcoded and not regulated through anything. 

Possible future update would be to use HC-05 Bluetooth module to control the module via smartphone but it is a bit of overkill. 

Components:
* 5v 3A switching power supply.
* WS2801 LED strip (1m in my case)
* 2x PIR sensors
* Bunch of 4-pin T-shaped connectors for soldering
* Heatshrinks
